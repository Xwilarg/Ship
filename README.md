# Ships
Display the differents ships between characters from an anime<br/>
https://ship.zirk.eu

## Philosophy
The community often like to ship characters even if they spoke only once with each others, and while some people might not like that, I really appreciate it.<br/>
That's why I decided to do this project, so you can discover ships you wouldn't have guessed that exist.<br/>
Since there are more girls than boys in anime there might be a lot of yuri (and also lot of NSFW content!)<br/>
I need to add things manually so if you want to help, feel free to read the next section!
